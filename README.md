# Neural Style Transfer of Live Video

---

## Introduction

This is a real time neural style transfer project for EE 461P Data Science Principles, at the University of Texas at Austin. The work here was created by [Kate Baumli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katebaumli/), [Daniel Diamont](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-diamont/), and [John Sigmon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-sigmon/). This is a public version of our work.

In making this project we used code from [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/examples) and a [GitHub project](https://github.com/peterliht/knowledge-distillation-pytorch) on network compression.
